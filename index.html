              <b>PROJECT STATEMENT<b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Mycocene is an art installation speculating on alternative views to the Anthropocene. The Mycocene hypothesizes an alternative framework where mycelium is the most prominent force of change on the planet's surface. This framework suggests a reality where our current use of technology is composted into one that has symbiosis in mind.. Symbiosis within the Mycocene blurs the line between conventional technology and nature and explores uses of technology that do not attempt to save nor exploit our ecosystems, but augment and communicate with them. How does mycology tie into such a future? “Mycelia is a highly redundant, complexley branched, self-repairing, and scalable communications network linking many species over tremendous distances.” (Paul Stamets) Mycelium is the communication highway between species, it is an integral link within ecosystems, functioning much like an internet of nutrients (much of which it creates through compost) and signals. In the spirit of this metaphor, the Mycocene project will repurpose electronic waste to be in symbiosis with this highly advanced natural system of mycelium–foregrounding the immense intelligence that nature exhibits which, as a species, we (humans) choose to ignore. Mycocene is an interpretation of a future where humans play a positive role in the Earth’s complex system of self-regulation, feedback, and evolution. It symbolizes a social and ecological revolution to save our planet and those living on it. Technology is part of our collective identity, we do not have to stop using technology as a species to help the Earth survive.  Instead, we need to change how we create and view our technology to benefit all species on a global level.

              <b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<b>
              <br>
              <br>
              In simple terms, mycelia are the roots of a mushroom. They extend vast ranges underground connecting a wide variety of organisms (plants, trees, fungi, insects). They function like the “brain” of the forest, allowing communication between species. For Mycocene, we will be building a symbiotic structure that incorporates mycelium into reclaimed electronic waste.  This waste often gets bundled together and shipped away (usually overseas, posing additional environmental threats) due to environmental toxicity. The mycelial network we are growing will be housed in a controlled acrylic habitat based off a rhizotron, which is used to study mushroom/plant growth. This will allow viewers to see the internal workings of the piece. Initially, the mycelium will be grown in Concordia’s BioLab in several petri dishes off gelatinous growth medium. The mycelium will be connected to custom electronic circuitry through a uniquely devised process: first, a conductive rod is wrapped with a copper coil that emits an electromagnetic field.  The coil has a controlled, faint current (around 1 volt at 0.5 amps) running through that affects mycelium growth via a phenomenon known as Galvanotropism. Galvanotropism is the ability to influence directional growth of fungal hyphae through electromagnetics. The mycelium will wrap itself around the coil and establish a robust electrical connection through which we will read micro voltages (the mycelium “life sign”). We will use amplification and noise reduction circuits to detect minute electrical perturbations in the network. These circuits will be housed within the rhizotron. Once we establish a reliable signal detection method we will use micro-controllers to record and analyze these signals computationally and channel them to the ‘waste’ electronics.  Reinvigorated with life and repurposed back into the earth (soil) from which their components are mined from, the electronics (in the form of old phone LCD screens, piezoelectric speakers, computer fans, etc.) will behave organically - unraveling memories from their past, but, most importantly, continuing their life symbiotically within the natural ecosystem. The rhizotron will we be suspended from the ceiling of a gallery setting with the e-waste hanging throughout the space. The observer can walk through the space and witness the “breathing” of life from the symbiotic structure.
